## 📖 About This Repository

**Apache Maven Zero to Hero** is a structured, beginner-friendly guide to one of the most widely used build automation tools in the Java ecosystem.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- ✅ Explain what Maven is and why it exists
- ✅ Understand Maven's architecture — POM, lifecycle, plugins, and repositories
- ✅ Read and write a `pom.xml` file with confidence
